Sky Python Transcriber 2 supports SVG icons for harp. Thanks to madwurmz for SVGs, and thanks to everyone for support <3

Sky: Light Awaits is an upcoming game by thatgamecompany, currently in beta and soft launch. This is a fan project. No affiliation with thatgamecompany.

# Installation

1. Click the green <kbd>Clone or Download</kbd> button in the top right, and then Download ZIP.

2. Save the folder to a location such as your Desktop and rename it. For the next command, I have the file saved on my Desktop and I've renamed the folder to `sky-transcriber`.

3. To run the program, open a Terminal and change directory to where the folder is â€” here I would type:

```
cd Desktop/sky-transcriber
```

Then type `python3 transcriber.py` on Mac, or `python transcriber.py` on Windows.
